# Frequently Asked Questions

![](assets/images/faq-heroe.svg)

We organize a few questions our partners face today in this session, and we'll continuously update this section if we receive new ones. If you want to be a Partner, just send an email to <partnership@zarv.com>.

## What integrations Zarv's API supports today?

We currently support receiving information from GPS Trackers, Radar Cameras (fixed and mobile), and fixed surveillance cameras.

## Can Zarv API receive streaming from cameras directly?

No, we currently do not process streaming videos. If you need a platform to host your video streams, we suggest you to use [Monuv](https://www.monuv.com.br/?utm_source=zarv-developers&utm_campaign=faq). They have native integration with us :smile:.

## How does Zarv's partner compensation work?

We built our model based on [Spotify](https://artists.spotify.com/en/help/article/royalties), where we distribute the bonus proportionally to the number of cameras participating in an occurrence.

For every equipment you have participating in a recovery operation, you'll  receive a proportional amount of money to them based on the total bonus available, simple like that :smile:
