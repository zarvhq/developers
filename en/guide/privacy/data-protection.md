# Data Protection Guide

## Introduction

At Zarv, we prioritize the privacy and security of our users' data. This guide outlines the measures we take to protect data and the best practices developers should follow to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

## Principles of Data Protection

1. **Transparency**: Clearly communicate how data is collected, used, and stored.
2. **Minimization**: Collect only the data necessary for the intended purpose.
3. **Security**: Implement robust measures to safeguard data from unauthorized access.
4. **Accountability**: Ensure compliance with data protection laws and maintain records of processing activities.

## Developer Responsibilities

### 1. Data Collection

- Use secure methods to collect data.
- Obtain explicit consent from users before collecting personal information.

### 2. Data Storage

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Store data in compliance with applicable regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### 3. Data Access

- Restrict access to authorized personnel only.
- Use role-based access controls (RBAC) to manage permissions.

### 4. Data Deletion

- Implement mechanisms for users to request data deletion.
- Ensure data is permanently removed from all systems upon deletion.

## Security Best Practices

- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
- Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing.
- Use secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection and XSS.

## Compliance with Regulations

Developers must stay informed about data protection laws relevant to their region and ensure that all practices align with these regulations. Key regulations include:

- **[Lei General de Proteção de Dados (LGPD)](./lgpd.md)**: Applicable to Brazil.
- **[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](./gdpr)**: Applicable to the European Union.
- **[California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)](./ccpa.md)**: Applicable to California residents.
