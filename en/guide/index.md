Welcome to Zarv's API guide! This section addresses common questions from our partners and will be updated regularly as new queries arise. If you're interested in becoming a partner, feel free to reach out to us at <partnership@zarv.com>.

## Overview of Zarv's API

Zarv's API is designed to provide seamless integration for various equipment and systems, enabling efficient data exchange and operational insights. Key features include:

- **Real-time Data Integration**: Connect GPS trackers, radar cameras, and surveillance systems to enable real-time monitoring and decision-making.
- **Partner Compensation Model**: Transparent and fair distribution of rewards for participating in recovery operations, ensuring equitable benefits for all partners.
- **Native Integrations**: Easily integrate with platforms like Monuv for video management, reducing the complexity of setup and maintenance.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large-scale operations, Zarv's API can support thousands of devices simultaneously.
- **Security**: Built with robust encryption and authentication mechanisms to ensure data privacy and integrity.

## Supported Integrations

Zarv's API currently supports the following integrations:

- **GPS Trackers**: Seamlessly integrate location data to track assets in real time.
- **Radar Cameras**: Both fixed and mobile radar cameras are supported, enabling advanced detection capabilities.
- **Fixed Surveillance Cameras**: Connect your surveillance systems with ease to enhance security and monitoring.
- **License Plate Recognition (LPR) Systems**: Integrate LPR systems to automate vehicle identification and tracking.

We are continuously working to expand our supported integrations. If you have specific requirements, please contact us at [developers@zarv.com](mailto:developers@zarv.com).

## Does Zarv's API Support Camera Streaming?

No, Zarv's API does not process live video streams. If you require a platform to host and manage your video streams, we recommend [Monuv](https://www.monuv.com.br/?utm_source=zarv-developers&utm_campaign=faq). Monuv offers native integration with Zarv, making it a great choice for your needs. :smile:

## Partner Compensation Model

Zarv's partner compensation model is inspired by [Spotify's royalty distribution system](https://artists.spotify.com/en/help/article/royalties). Here's how it works:

- Compensation is distributed proportionally based on the number of cameras participating in a recovery operation.
- For each piece of equipment involved, you'll receive a share of the total bonus available.
- Bonuses are calculated dynamically based on the complexity and success rate of the operation.

This model ensures fairness and incentivizes active participation. For more details, contact us at [developers@zarv.com](mailto:developers@zarv.com).
