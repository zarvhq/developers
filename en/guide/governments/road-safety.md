- Regularly maintain and repair roads to prevent accidents caused by poor conditions.

### 3. Promote Public Awareness

- Launch educational campaigns to inform citizens about road safety rules and best practices.
- Partner with schools to teach children about pedestrian and cycling safety.
- Use social media and public service announcements to reach a wider audience.

### 4. Invest in Technology

- Deploy intelligent traffic management systems to monitor and control traffic flow.
- Use speed cameras and red-light cameras to enforce compliance.
- Encourage the adoption of advanced vehicle safety features, such as automatic braking systems.

### 5. Strengthen Emergency Response

## Measuring Success

- Track road accident statistics to evaluate the effectiveness of safety measures.
