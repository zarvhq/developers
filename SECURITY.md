# Security Policy

This document outlines the security policy for our internal team. As this repository is private, please ensure all communications and actions adhere to the guidelines below.

## Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions of our software. Ensure you are using a supported version to receive the latest security patches and updates:

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.x   | :x:                |

If you are using an unsupported version, upgrade to a supported version to maintain security compliance.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities must be handled with the utmost confidentiality. If you identify a vulnerability, follow these steps to report it internally:

1. **Do not disclose outside the team.**  
  Avoid sharing details of the vulnerability outside the internal team or in public forums.

2. **Report via internal channels:**  
  Use the designated Slack channel [#team-engineers](https://zarv.slack.com/archives/C0354C756HL) to report the issue.

3. **Provide detailed information:**  
  Include the following in your report to facilitate investigation:

   - Steps to reproduce the issue, including any relevant code or configurations.
   - The potential impact of the vulnerability.
   - Any suggested fixes or patches, if available.
   - Your contact information for follow-up questions.

4. **Internal disclosure only:**  
  All discussions and resolutions must remain within the internal team. Public disclosure is strictly prohibited unless explicitly approved by the security team.

Thank you for your diligence in maintaining the security and integrity of our project. Your efforts are critical to protecting our systems and data.
